Last night I gave a talk for JavaScriptLA on game development. It went really well and I want to thank Vijay and JavaScriptLA for organizing the talk and everyone that came out for being a great audience.

This was my first talk, and I learned a lot about presenting just from the act of doing it. Vijay gave me two guidelines (repeat the questions and don't walk into the projection) and I know I forgot about those two simple rules several times, but with practice I hope to make better habits.

I also learned a lot about what I should present, because, as long as 70 minutes sounds, it still isn't enough time to cover everything I wanted to. I know I need to prioritize the types of information I am showing. I am going to start a Game Development series here, and I hope that will allow me to fill in the gaps.

I'll also be updating this post with some code samples, a list of resources and links, and some other things.

As always, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments or corrections!
