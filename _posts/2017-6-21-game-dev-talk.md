Last night I gave a talk for JavaScriptLA on game development. It went really well and I want to thank Vijay and JavaScriptLA for organizing the talk and everyone that came out for being a great audience.

This was my first talk, and I learned a lot about presenting just from the act of doing it. Vijay gave me two guidelines (repeat the questions and don't walk into the projection) and I know I forgot about those two simple rules several times, but with practice I hope to make better habits.

I also learned a lot about what I should present, because, as long as 70 minutes sounds, it still isn't enough time to cover everything I wanted to. I know I need to prioritize the types of information I am showing. I am going to start a Game Development series here, and I hope that will allow me to fill in the gaps.

So here are some of the links from the talk:

<a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce">The Phaser Documentation</a>

<a href="https:http://phaser.io/examples">Phaser Code Examples</a> (Great resource!)

<a href="https://github.com/SPHornsby/phaser-template">My Phaser Template </a>

<a href="https://pixlr.com">Pixlr</a> (Image editor) 

<a href="https://piskelapp.com">Piskel</a> (Sprites) 

<a href="https://bfxr.net">Bfxr</a> (Sound fx)

My Phaser template comes setup for running unit tests and broswerify, but those things are completely unnecessary. Aside from Phaser itself, the only other necessary piece of code is the Express server (to avoid cross origin file serving). Gulp, Broswerify, and Mocha/Chai will be covered separately <a href="#">here</a>.

As always, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments or corrections!
