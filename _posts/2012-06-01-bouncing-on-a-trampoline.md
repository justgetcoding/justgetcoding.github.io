================

I often get hung up on explaining how I make my clown "bounce"" on a trampoline in the Circus game that I use in my XNA presentations.  I know I introduce some basic trigonometry that we've all long since forgotten.  Considering my lack of engineering degree and poor grades in trig, I always assumed that everyone else in the room would just get it and I could easily move on.
