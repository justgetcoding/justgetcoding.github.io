It may not feel like it, but you've just taken on a whole heap of information. I tried to keep it simple without dumbing it down. I know you can handle it. The main trunk of JavaScript has a lot of branches, and it can be easy to get distracted. I want you to be aware of them, but it isn't important that you use or even understand them.

We're going to start writing more code. If you aren't comfortable using `let` and `const`, there is nothing wrong with sticking to `var`. It works. It worked for a long time. Get used to writing code first. In the early stages, I will be using ES5 code as much as possible. As we get further along I will shift toward ES6 code. You'll know when we get there when you start seeing fat arrow functions. I'm looking forward to it!

If you don't like the way I write code, that's ok. If you find a way you like better, use it. There are a lot of opinions in programming, and a lot of ways to write the same code. I'll explain my style and opinions as we get to them, and I will tell you about problems I have run into and ways I have decided to strategically mitigate those problems. Plus, I am not done learning. There are so many things I learn that change the way I think about code.

We talked about tool choices, but I left it in your hands. I use VSCode. I used Atom in school, and I really enjoyed it, but the integrated terminal and node debugger of VSCode won me over. They are both free. For the terminal, I use zsh, but there is nothing wrong with bash, or iTerm (which I also use). If you are on a windows machine, I know there are options as well, but I don't know them. You can use the regular install of node, I am not sure what version is in vogue right now, but I generally use 6.11. I have also installed nvm, which is... wait for it, node version manager. It allows me to quickly specify different versions of node. It's really not that important for now.

Now, prepare yourself, next lesson we are going to write some code!
