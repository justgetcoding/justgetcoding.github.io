If you haven't read the intro, do that [here](/intro/2017/03/05/elements-of-computing.html).
Otherwise, let's just jump in.

In this course, I am going to build a series of successively more complex chips. These
chips will be composed of chips I have already built. But to get started, there needs to be
a foundation chip. There are theoretical options, but this course uses the NAND gate. The NAND
is a functionally complete gate. What that means is that every chip in this program could be built
solely from NAND gates. In essence, that is what I am going to do, although in practice, I will hide
that away by creating new chips. The NAND is given is already implemented.

From the simple NAND gate, I will build NOT, AND, OR. But to do that, I need to explain what a
NAND gate does. NAND stands for Not AND. It is the opposite of an AND gate, and returns false (0)
if a=1 and b=1, and true for every other combination. This seems like a good spot for a truth table.
```
|  a  |  b  || Nand(a,b)|
|:---:|:---:||:--------:|
| 0   | 0   ||    1     |
| 1   | 0   ||    1     |
| 0   | 1   ||    1     |
| 1   | 1   ||    0     |
```
Open /projects/01 and find Not.hdl. This is what it should look like:
```
/**
 * Not gate:
 * out = not in
 */

CHIP Not {
    IN in;
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    // Put your code here:
}
```
The intro post covered the hdl format, so if it doesn't make sense, go back and take
another look. 

A NOT chip has one input and one output. Out should be not in (!in). So if in is 1, out
is 0 and vice versa. Time for another truth table!
```
| a |out|
|---|---|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |
```
How can I get that output with only a NAND chip? The first thing that stood out to me is that
a NAND has two inputs, but I only have one to work with. How can I handle that? A brief aside on HDL
syntax. The parts section is composed of other chips. To use one, you just call the chip name
and pass it the required parameters. A NAND chip has two ins (a and b) and one out (out).

```
Nand(a=something, b=somethingElse, out=oneMoreThing);
// and implementation might be:
Nand(a=in, b=in, out=out);
```
I just used in twice because that's all I have to work with, one IN, one OUT. It turns out
though, I just (accidentally) wrote a NOT chip
```
CHIP Not {
    IN in;
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    // Put your code here:

}
```

Remeber the NAND truth table? What happens if I only use the entries where a and b are th same?

```
|  a  |  b  || Nand(a,b)|
|:---:|:---:||:--------:|
| 0   | 0   ||    1     |
| 1   | 1   ||    0     |

|  a & b  || Nand(a,b)|
|:-------:||:--------:|
|    0    ||    1     |
|    1    ||    0     |
```
Looks just like the not truth table, perfect. Once I started thinking this way, writing the simpler
chips became just a matter of manipulating the truth table. Here is the truth table for the next gate
AND:

```
|  a  |  b  || And(a,b)|
|:---:|:---:||:--------:|
| 0   | 0   ||    0     |
| 1   | 0   ||    0     |
| 0   | 1   ||    0     |
| 1   | 1   ||    1     |
```
The outputs for And are the opposite of the outputs for Nand (not surprising given their names). That
makes AND !NAND (not NAND). Well I just happen to have a NAND gate and a NOT gate, how can I wire
those together?

```
    PARTS:
    Nand(a=a, b=b, out=w1);
    Not(in=w1, out=out);
```
Earlier I said that NAND is functionally complete, and that I could build every other gate using only
NANDs. After all, my Not gate is just composed of one NAND gate. What if I swap that in?
```
    PARTS:
    Nand(a=a, b=b, out=w1);
    Nand(a=w1, b=w1, out=out);
```
Those are equivalent. In this case, it is simple, because a NOT is just one NAND anyway. This means, however, that I could have built the AND without using NOT, and even without ever conceptualizing NOT.
This can be very powerful. It is helpful to build up my logic library one step at a time, but it is
also completely unnecessary. If I am stuck, I can always step away from the vocabulary I have built,
and use fundamentals (like NAND alone), or invent new intermediary words to help me along the path.
There are "right" ways to build these gates, but that shouldn't stop me from experimenting. Once I
have it working, I can always refine my implementation ([sound familiar?](/intro/2017/03/01/testing.html)).
