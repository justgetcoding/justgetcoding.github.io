If you haven't read the intro, do that [here](/intro/2017/03/05/elements-of-computing.html). Otherwise,
let's just jump in.

In this course, we are going to build a series of successively more complex chips. These
chips will be composed of chips we have already built. But to get started, we have to have
a foundation chip. For us, that will be the NAND gate. The NAND is a functionally complete
gate. What that means is that we could, if we wished, build every chip in this
program solely from NAND gates. In fact, that is essnetially what we do, however, for
convenience, we create integrated circuits (ICs) and then use the bundled ICs to make new
chips. The NAND is given to us, we don't need to implement it.

From the simple NAND gate, we are going to build NOT, AND, OR. Before we do that, let's
talk about what a NAND gate does. NAND stands for Not AND. It is the opposite of an AND
gate, and returns false (0) if a=1 and b=1, and true for every other combination. This is
a good spot for a truth table.
```
|  a  |  b  || Nand(a,b)|
|:---:|:---:||:--------:|
| 0   | 0   ||    1     |
| 1   | 0   ||    1     |
| 0   | 1   ||    1     |
| 1   | 1   ||    0     |
```
Open /projects/01 and find Not.hdl. This is what it should look like:
```
/**
 * Not gate:
 * out = not in
 */

CHIP Not {
    IN in;
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    // Put your code here:
}
```
The intro post covered the hdl format, so if it doesn't make sense, go back and take
another look. 

A NOT chip has one input and one output. Out should be not in (!in). So if in is 1, out
is 0 and vice versa. Time for another truth table!
```
| a |out|
|---|---|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |
```
Take a moment to think about what we can do, using just NAND chips, to get that output.
The first thing that stood out to me is that a NAND has two inputs, but we only have one to work with. How can we get around that? While you ponder, another note on HDL syntax.
The parts we are going to use are other chips. To use one, you just call the chip name
and pass it the required parameters. A NAND chip has two ins (a and b) and one out (out).

```
Nand(a=something, b=somethingElse, out=oneMoreThing);
// and implementation might be:
Nand(a=in, b=in, out=out);
```
I just used in twice because that's all I have to work with, one IN, one OUT. It turns out
though, I just wrote a NOT chip
```
CHIP Not {
    IN in;
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    // Put your code here:

}
```
