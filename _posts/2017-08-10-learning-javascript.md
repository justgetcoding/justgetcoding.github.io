Let's learn JavaScript! Most of the time, you will see JavaScript bundled into a web development course, and for good reason. It is the only language the browser understands natively. That's pretty useful. Typically it will be part 3, behind HTML and CSS. That makes sense too. The web is HTML, and without CSS it looks pretty... 1990. JavaScript is used to enhance the web. These days it is also used on the server, in the form of Node, and even on the desktop, with Electron. So there are plenty of reasons to learn JavaScript, and plenty of ways to learn it. Here, you are going to learn it first.

There are some tools that are available to make writing (and therefore learning) JavaScript easier. Many of these tools come with choices and opinions and, mostly, there are no wrong answers. The first tool is an IDE, or integrated development environment. For me, this includes simple code editors, although many people differentiate between the two. I put them on a spectrum. Code Editors are simple, and light weight. IDEs are complex, and offer a lot of bells and whistles. The reality is, you can code in either. Or neither. You could open up your browser, get into the developer console, and write JavaScript right there.  You could open a text editor and type away, making sure to save the files with the .js file extension. You could, but I wouldn't recommend it. What I would recommend is trying out Atom and/or VSCode. They are simple to install and simple to use, and offer some very convenient features like code hightlighting and extensibility.

You are also going to need to install Node. Node is a JavaScript runtime based on the V8 engine. It is very similar to the way JavaScript will run on the browser, in the real world. Node also comes with a package manager, surprisingly enough called NPM, that is very handy. In some circles it is being supplanted by a different package manager called Yarn, and eventually we will explore that topic. A nice code editor, and node with npm, will allow us to start writing JavaScript easily.

There are a plethora of other tools and tricks that people have, and that you will develop over time (or perhaps you already have a few of your own). Shell scripting comes in handy for several reasons. Any unix experience can only help. A love for the command line becomes indespensible.

I am going to be honest with you. It is a big world. There is a lot to learn. There is probably not enough time in your day to day to learn everything you need. That is ok. The best lesson I can give you will have nothing to do with esoteric computer science topics, or the latest in web frameworks. It is this: Take it one bite at a time. It will come to you. You will get more comfortable, both with what you know and with the idea of how much you don't know. You will learn how and what to learn by learning and by doing. It will get easier. You can do this.
