As a programmer with no formal training, I am always looking for ways
to pick up more CS fundamentals. Getting practical programming concepts is "easy,"
just start working on projects. You will develop some sort of competence rapidly.
However, there are a whole lot of topics that you may have skipped over, had no
time to learn, or just didn't understand quickly enough. Algorithms are one of these
topics (one I cover in other posts). At an even lower level, perhaps the lowest level, is
the topic of how computers compute.

I was fully aware of my ignorance on that subject, but also satisfied that it wasn't necessary
to learn all of that CS stuff in order to be a good programmer. I still feel like this is
probably true, but I've come to realize two things. First, I don't want to be a good programmer,
I want to be a great programmer. Second, it is going to help get better at acquiring every other
skill I want/need. Anything that makes programming less mysterious, makes the programmer more
powerful.

My brother told me he had been working through a course on building a computer from the ground up
and that he thought I would find it interesting. That was yesterday, and I haven't been able to stop
working through the problems and reading the material. Far from being academically dull or too mathematically
advanced, it has been engaging and surprisingly simple, at first. the challenge level ramps up. The more
I completed, the more I began to think about how I could apply these lessons on a broader level. Over
the next weeks, I am going to be writing a series on this course and my progression through it. 

The course is called "Building a Modern Computer from First Principles," and is referred to as, "Nand2Tetris," and
everything you need to follow along is <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">here</a>.

Tools I am using include:
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [Logic.ly](https://logic.ly/download/)
* The [software downloads](http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php) from the nand2tetris project.
