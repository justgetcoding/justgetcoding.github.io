So, about a year ago I stopped working on personal projects. I left them, abandoned, to gather dust. I shouldn't have done this, no matter how compelling I thought my reasons were.

Code rusts. Dependancies change. Browsers change. Frameworks change. The more one relies on these things (which is unavoidable), the faster your code can become rusty, out-of-date, and/or broken. Active projects, maintained projects, get rust-resistance as a consequence of being looked at, and run, often. That isn't to say that maintenance is cost-free. It absolutely isn't. However, paying it in an ongoing fashion is way easier than coming back to code that is 2 or 6 or 12 months old and having to do it all at once. That's a lesson I shouldn't have had to learn by doing, but here we are.

Knowledge rusts. I write these posts in Markdown. I use Jekyll with Github pages to deal with, well, everything. Outside of this blog I use markdown seldom and Jekyll not at all. Neither of these things are particularly difficult, but without constant reinforcement, any familiarity I had with them is gone. The things I want to do with this blog, which may have been nearly trivial a year ago, are now too time consuming to deal with immediately.

Infrastructure rusts. Domain names and certificates expire. Hosting solutions change. 

#### So What Happened?

To paraphrase Westly:
>Life is hard, anyone who says differently is selling something.

We are all coming to this journey from different places. I can't begin to understand what things are particularly difficult for each of you. What struggles you are going through. What limits you have on your time or money or other resources. I won't even begin to pretend that I am not the beneficiary of some pretty hefty amounts of privilege. And even with all of that, it was still incredibly difficult for me to get where I am. 

This is hard.

(Even) successful people have struggles. Struggling people have successes. If you are struggling, it does not mean you are failing. In my opinion, it means the opposite. For a long time I felt like acknowledging my struggles publicly would make me look like a failure. All that did, for me, was stunt my growth. It meant I couldn't tap into the knowledge of this massive community of people who have also struggled and floundered and in the end, solved those problems in some way or another. It meant I couldn't get the emotional support from this wonderful community. 

We can build awesome, interesting, fun, stupid, trivial, important, educational, incredible things and still not have it all figured out. We are human. We can have good days and bad days and in between days, and that is ok. We can talk about our struggles and failures and foibles and screw ups and it doesn't diminish us.

It was "easy" when I had a mostly full time job and a stable home life. When all of that changed, it became a lot less easy. I didn't change my priorities and actions fast enough in response, and it lead me into a downward spiral. It took me more than six months to find employment again. Six months I couldn't really afford to be unemployed. Six months that tore me down emotionally. I was lucky in that I had a support system that kept me afloat, but it was really hard on me and those around me.

When I came out the other side of that maelstrom, I didn't pick up where I left off. My personal projects had all stalled, and I left them to keep rusting. I picked up other projects, but they were all cloaked in the idea of making me more employable. They weren't passion projects. I am definitely a better developer than I was a year ago, but I haven't given back at all. I am a happier person when I am helping others. I had forgotten that. I'm back.

#### Why now?

Last week freeCodeCamp added a talk I gave a year ago to their resources. It was unexpected, reinvigorating, and frightening. I have had people reach out to me to ask about the talk and the projects I talked about, and now I am looking at code I last touched 10+ months ago. So much has changed.

The two biggest changes related to my particular talk are the framework I used (Phaser) went from v2 to v3, and Chrome stopped autoplaying web media by default (vast oversimplification). This had the effect of first breaking my code and then making me rethink how I fixed it. It is "simple" enough to add some user interaction to let the games work in browser. However, I think I should also update the projects to use the latest "stuff". So over the course of the next week or so, that is what I am going to try to do. Rewrite the projects to use, at the very least, Phaser3. Hopefully I can find other ways to update the code while I'm in there.

#### Takeaway

The thing I most want to say is, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read this or watch my talk. Thank you for asking questions and helping me find answers. Thank you for encouraging me to be a better developer and a better human being. Thank you for your patience while I keep figuring out how life works.
